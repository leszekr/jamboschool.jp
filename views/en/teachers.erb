<h1>David Howenstein</h1>

<p>David Howenstein had been working with NHK Bunka Center for about 20 years and set up JAMBO School in September 2012 at the time NHK Bunka Center Toyocho was closing.  In addition to his full-time work as an English teacher (privately and at various community centers, university, and self-designed classes), David has been running JAMBO International Center (JIC) since 1996.  JIC is based on the concept of Having Fun, Doing Good - volunteering, hiking, and taking part in international get-togethers while raising money for various environmental / development groups (<a href="http://www.jambointernational.org" target="_blank">http://www.jambointernational.org</a>). </p><br>
